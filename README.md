## Introduction:
 Introducing a Book Bank Blockchain Platform for Researchers, providing a platform where researchers can mint their research papers and publish them, while also being able to secure funding through the platform.

With the aim of introducing researchers and scholars to the world of cryptocurrencies, DeFi, and NFTs, our platform offers a unique opportunity to combine traditional academic publishing with the power of blockchain technology. By using our platform, researchers can increase the visibility of their work, while also being able to secure funding through the use of cryptocurrency.

Our platform offers a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of publishing research papers and minting them as NFTs. The platform also provides researchers with the ability to track and manage their published work, as well as access funding opportunities directly through the platform.

Join us in the revolution of academic publishing, as we combine traditional academic practices with the security and transparency of blockchain technology.

* Book Bank is a blockchain platform designed for researchers to mint and publish their research papers.
* The platform uses minting to validate the research paper and link it securely with the author, ensuring the originality of the paper and preventing piracy and duplication.
* Researchers can also receive funding on the same platform, which is a crucial support for many researchers whose work may get dropped due to lack of funding and support.
* By funding research papers on Book Bank, researchers are motivated to carry forward their research work and contribute to the scientific community.
